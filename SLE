function D = dijkstra(A, nodes)
    % This function takes an adjacency matrix called G
    % and a p-by-2 matrix called pairs.
    % The pairs matrix will contain pairs of indices.
    % This function will determine the shortest distance from
    % the first index in the pair to the second index for
    % every pair in matrix pairs.
    %
    % The function will only return a p-by-1 matrix of shortest
    % distances. I could use it to also return the shortest path,
    % but I don't need that data, so only shortest distance is
    % calculated.

    p = size(pairs, 1);  % Number of pairs
    v = size(G, 1); % Number of vertices
    D = [];
