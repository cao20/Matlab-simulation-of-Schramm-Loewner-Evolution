# Matlab-simulation of Schramm Lowener Evolution
The Schramm Lowener Evolution is a "young" mathematical branch (1999) concerned with the conformally invariant stochastic process. This theory describes a class of random planar curves, obtained (by Schramm) by solving Lowener equations when the driving function (input) takes the form of brownian motion. Such curves are governed by chi which plays the role of the diffusion coefficient for the driving function.
This matlab program (3 files: SLE.m, fz1.m, fz2.m ) simulates such curves for any value of chi for various planar processes:

chi=0 ; vertical slit

chi=2,  Loop Erased Random Walk (LERW)

chi =8/3, Self-Avoiding Walk
